## SpeakCode
A speech recognizer written in Java based on Sphinx4 library.

# Code Example

The user "tells" the program what they want for their program like:<br>
(Sequence of instructions)<br>
1. Create a new public class<br>
2. create a main function<br>
3. new string<br>
4. new integer<br>
5. close function<br>
6. end<br>

And the resultant output would be-<br>
<br>Public class Class1<br>
{<br>
	public static void main(String args[])<br>
        {<br>
                private String str1;<br>
                private int int1;<br>
        }<br>
}<br>
