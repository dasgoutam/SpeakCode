# SpeakCode
A speech recognizer written in Java based on Sphinx4 library.

Example - The user "tells" the program what they want for their program like:
Sequence of instructions
1. Create a new public class
2. create a main function
3. new string
4. new integer
5. close function
6. end

And the resultant output would be-
Public class Class1
{
        public static void main(String args[])
        {
                private String str1;
                private int int1;
        }
}

Under development...
